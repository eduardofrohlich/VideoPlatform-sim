## ðŸ’­ About this project</h2>

#### â–¶ This project was proposed by the online course Curso em Video, using concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
### ðŸ§  Overview of this Project:
> Creation of a `Video Actions` interface: *play(), pause() and like()* methods;

> Creation of a `User` Superclass: *name, age, gender, experience variables and a winXp()* method;

> Creation of a `Video`Subclass: inherits from **Video Actions**. It contains *title, review, views, likes, and isPlaying* variables;

> Creation of a `Viewer` Subclass: inherits from **User**. It contains *login and total Watched* variables;

> Creation of a aggregator `View` class: It's an aggregator class from **Viewer** and **Video**. It contains *spectator and videoWatched variables*.<br>
Also it contains a polymorphic toRate() method, allowing the Viewer to rate a video automatically, by a note or according to its % of video watched as well.
